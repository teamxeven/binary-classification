# binary-classification

Description:

This GitHub repository contains code for a binary classification project aimed at detecting lung cancer from X-ray images. We implemented a custom convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, tailored to the specific needs of the task. The model's unique architecture includes custom layers designed to optimize feature extraction from X-ray images.

In addition to the custom CNN, we employed data augmentation techniques to expand our dataset. Data augmentation is a crucial step for improving model generalization and robustness, especially when working with limited data. Our augmented dataset enables the model to learn from a more diverse range of X-ray images, enhancing its ability to make accurate predictions.

The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of lung X-ray images, making this repository a valuable resource for anyone interested in medical image classification and deep learning.

Explore our code and model to gain insights into our approach for lung cancer detection, or use it as a foundation for your own medical image classification projects.
